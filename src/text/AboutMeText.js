const AboutMe = `Hello! My name is David Jeseung Ha and I am a rising Senior at Vanderbilt University majoring in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics. I was born in South Korea and came to California when I was in the second grade. I only started programming once I arrived to college, but I fell in love with coding ever since. As an adept (CS 3251) Intermediate Software design Teaching Assistant at Vanderbilt University now, I have a well-rounded skill set in explaining concepts to students and honed talents in debugging students' code. Last summer, I worked on a startup called Traded which is an E-commerce platform where college students can buy and sell items to other college students on campus. This summer, I was a Software Developer Engineer Intern at Enlyte, which is a P&C company that specializes in Auto Physical Damages. I was on the Mitchell Cloud Repair team, where I mainly worked on creating a microservice "MC-JAVA-EMS-SCANNED-JOB-INTERNAL-CLEAN-UP-API" that deletes EMS Scanned jobs from the Mitchell Connect website. Currently, I am looking for a full time role as a Software Engineer. Click here to learn more about the projects I have worked on!`;
