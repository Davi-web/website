const AboutMe = `Hello! My name is David Jeseung Ha and I am a junior at Vanderbilt University majoring in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics and minoring in Engineering Management. I was born in South Korea and came to California when I was in the second grade. I only started programming once I arrived to college, but I fell in love with coding ever since. As an adept (CS 3251) Intermediate Software design Teaching Assistant at Vanderbilt University now, I have a well-rounded skill set in explaining concepts to students and honed talents in debugging students' code. This summer, I worked on a startup called Traded which is an E-commerce platform where college students can buy and sell items to other college students on campus. I am currently looking for an opportunity as a Software Engineer internship role this summer. Click here to learn more about the projects I have worked on!`;
